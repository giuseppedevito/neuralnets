## Talking about Neural Networks Basis

## Introduction

## NeuralNet.cc

Beginning steps with Arduino to x86 porting; just to understanding the original code.  
### Don't use it.

## Perceptron
Basic single layer Neural Network with Sigmoid activation function, two input codes ((1,0) and (0,1)) and just the regression line x-y=0.

Compilation

g++ -o Perceptron Perceptron.cc

Execution

./Perceptron <number of training cycles>
  
Example

./Perceptron 1000
